 * An interface that represents a language supported by simpl; Should be part of a "language package" in

 * In general: Implementers of this interface represent the core unique aspects of names in a language. The class
 * should presumably hold onto some list of reserved words, provide a check for those reserved words, and also provide
 * means for translating from simpl cross platform names to the language's appropriate names (and back and forth).
 * 
 * Testing heuristics: Random strings should probably never trigger the isReserved() checks, 
 * marshalling from cross-platform name to language name and back shoudl always return the same string.
