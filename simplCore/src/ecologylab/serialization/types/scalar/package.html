Provides an extensible type system for translating fields to and from String
representations. Comes with support for primitive types and common
reference types, such as String, Color, and URL. Includes
straightforward facilities for extension to support any
type. Specifically, to add support for a new type, extend the 
{@link ecologylab.xml.types.scalar.Type Type} class.
