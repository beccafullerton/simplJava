/**
 * This class provides access to a pool of pre-allocated resources. The pool grows and contracts
 * throughout its lifetime to suit the number of resources necessary and to attempt to minimize
 * memory footprints; acquire() and release() are amortized O(1) complexity (although
 * expansion/contraction triggers may take longer).
 * 
 * The primary way of accessing resources that are controlled by a pool are through the acquire and
 * release methods. Every acquire should have a matching release, to ensure that resources may be
 * recycled by later calls to acquire.
 * 
 * Subclasses of ResourcePool ensure that the resources obtained through the acquire method are
 * "clean", that is, they are immediately ready for use as if they were just instantiated.
